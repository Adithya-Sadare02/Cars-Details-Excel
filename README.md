This project analyzes a comprehensive dataset of car listings, featuring key attributes like brand, model, fuel type, transmission, engine capacity, mileage, price, and body type. The goal is to perform exploratory data analysis, visualize market trends, and prepare the data for price prediction models and brand comparisons.
**🔍 Key Insights**
Luxury brands like BMW and Audi show higher average prices, while Hyundai and Chevrolet represent budget segments.
Fuel types (Petrol, Diesel, etc.) and transmission types are analyzed to understand consumer preferences.
Ownership trends (Individual vs Corporate) and location-based listings (e.g., Bangalore, Ahmedabad) are highlighted.
**📊 Pivot & Charts**
Pivot tables summarize total and average prices, model counts, and ownership distributions.
Visualizations include bar charts (average price by brand), pie charts (fuel type share), and stacked columns (ownership by city).
